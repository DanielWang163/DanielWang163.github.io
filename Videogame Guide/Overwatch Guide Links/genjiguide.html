        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Genji is a versatile flanker with very high mobility, boasting some of the best movement options of all the 
            <br>
            heroes. Genji is better suited for close quarters to make use of his mobility and spread shurikens, but can
            <br>
            still be formidable at range. Cyber-Agility makes Genji a difficult target and allows him to navigate the
            <br>
            map with ease. Swift Strike allows Genji to engage, escape or move between targets efficiently. The damage
            <br>
            on Swift Strike is considerable for most heroes but is insignificant to a tank. As such, Genji should use
            <br>
            Swift Strike to either maneuver around his enemies or deal small but quick and easy damage. Deflect allows
            <br>
            Genji to turn enemies' damage back towards them and even allows him to turn around entire ultimate
            <br>
            abilities. This allows for potentially lethal burst damage if it is timed properly and Genji is well
            <br>
            positioned. Be wary when estimating your own abilities as Genji however, you are not the most agile hero
            <br>
            nor do you deal the most damage. Genji fills a middle ground when it comes to these factors. Genji is a
            <br>
            deadly offensive threat, capable of easily sneaking behind enemy lines and harassing his opponents with
            <br>
            constant volleys of shurikens. You should always be taking side routes in order to flank the enemy team, as
            <br>
            Genji contributes much less when he's merely hanging back with his team. Remember to not get too far away
            <br>
            from them, however, as Genji has much less capability to escape from bad engagements compared to Tracer.
            <br>
            Genji is usually better at fighting his enemies mid-range, rather than up close. He lacks the evasiveness
            <br>
            of Tracer and the damage/self-healing of Reaper, making him vulnerable to being killed if he opts to get
            <br>
            too close to the enemy team. Only engage up close if either Dragonblade is up, or if the enemy you're
            <br>
            fighting is vulnerable (such as a lone Widowmaker).
            <br>
            Deflect provides Genji with an incredibly high skill ceiling. It can be used to deflect everything from
            <br>
            Pharah's Barrage, to Tracer's Pulse Bomb, to McCree's Deadeye, allowing you to rapidly turn the tables on
            <br>
            almost any engagement. Smarter enemies will usually wait for you to use Deflect before using their
            <br>
            abilities, so don't use Deflect too early. Trick them into thinking that your Deflect is on cooldown, then
            <br>
            use it at the right moment to send their most dangerous attacks flying back at them.
            <br>
            A good burst damage combo is to use the secondary fire of Shuriken up close, followed by a Swift Strike.
            <br>
            This will provide heavy burst damage that will kill many injured players instantly.
            <br>
            The wall climb of Cyber-Agility has a variety of uses, even in combat. When fighting near a doorway, get
            <br>
            your enemy to chase you towards the doorway, then use Cyber-Agility to climb up over top of it and ambush
            <br>
            them when they come through.
            <br>
            You must choose the moment to use Dragonblade carefully. Genji is not any more durable than normal while
            <br>
            using it, meaning that your enemies can easily knock you away and kill you at range if you use it
            <br>
            inappropriately. Try to use Dragonblade when there are multiple enemies with low base Health (such as
            <br>
            Symmetra or Mercy) within reach, as this will let you quickly kill them and chain your Swift Strikes to
            <br>
            both eliminate more targets and remain evasive to survive longer. Make sure you're within melee range of
            <br>
            your enemies before activating it.
