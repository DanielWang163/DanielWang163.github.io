        <p>Damage: Depends on Nuke</p>
        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            D.Va is a unique tank with some mobility. With very high health and Boosters, she can close a gap to the
            <br>
            enemy with ease. She has high damage output at close-range, making her a strong fighter in a 1-on-1 match.
            <br>
            Her Defense Matrix is useful against all incoming projectiles, protecting her teammates from enemy fire.
            <br>
            The Micro Missiles deal high amount of damage when used in close range. She is a dangerous ganker in tank
            <br>
            class, dealing consistent damage to the enemy. Self-Destruct will wipe all opponents within the blast area.
            <br>
            However, she doesn't have an extended barrier to properly protect her team like Reinhardt. She is also slow
            <br>
            while firing, allowing the enemy to outrun her to disengage or move around her to distract her aiming. Both
            <br>
            Fusion Cannons and Micro Missiles are ineffective at anything further than medium-range, meaning she can be
            <br>
            outranged by the enemy before she even has a chance to close a gap with Boosters.While D.Va is considered a
            <br>
            Tank, a lot of successful D.Va players use her like Reaper. Ganking and harassing are some of D.Va's strong
            <br>
            suits. Her high damage output at close range coupled with her Boosters movement ability makes it easy for
            <br>
            her to get "shotgun-like" damage in and escape with ease. 
            <br>
            Defense Matrix is especially strong against most damage dealers. It can even negate a dangerous bullet from
            <br>
            McCree's Deadeye or even Pharah's Barrage. 
            <br>
            You can close the gap on most heroes with Boosters, but you will be susceptible to enemy fire while 
            <br>
            airborne. Defense Matrix can be used during Boosters, so activate it while flying towards a target that's
            <br>
            shooting at you. 
            <br>
            You need to prioritize protecting the team from flankers and snipers, potentially by rushing them down at
            <br>
            close range. Snipers are your first target since they are vulnerable at close range followed by other 
            <br>
            damage dealers depending on the situation and their position. 
            <br>
            It is not recommended to play D.Va as the sole tank on your team. Solo-tanking with her is extremely 
            <br>
            difficult due to her lack of shield and short duration of Defense Matrix. She can't offensively eliminate
            <br>
            an entire enemy team by herself like a Damage hero, and she can't provide extended cover like a shield tank
            <br>
            such as Reinhardt or Orisa, but she can alternate between the two roles in short, well-timed bursts. 
            <br>
            Strategize where and when to place a Self-Destructing Mech. The 3 seconds countdown of Self-Destruct is 
            <br>
            long enough for your enemies to find cover or get behind a friendly Barrier. One effective tool is to use
            <br>
            Boosters before Self-Destruct to send the Ultimate out from a blind spot towards a place where there is 
            <br>
            less cover. 
            <br>
            D.Va's high damage in her Mech is useful against Tanks. Due to their large size and slow speed, the burst
            <br>
            damage of Micro Missiles and Fusion Cannons can chew through a lot of health. 
            <br>
            Even though Defense Matrix will destroy all projectiles, it will not absorb beams such as Zarya's Particle
            <br>
            Cannon, Mei's Endothermic Blaster, Moira's Biotic Grasp, or Symmetra's Photon Projector. 
            <br>
            D.Va has a large critbox in front of her Mech (the cockpit). You will receive critical damage easier than
            <br>
            most heroes, so avoid turning your Mech to face oncoming fire without Defense Matrix active. 
            <br>
            Ramming an enemy with Boosters deals damage in addition to mild knockback, which may be enough to finish
            <br>
            off a low-health opponent. 
            <br>
            If you melee attack an enemy player while D.Va's Boosters are active, you will deal greatly increased 
            <br>
            damage and knockback to the target, allowing easy environmental kills. 
            <br>
            When out of the suit, D.Va's primary goal is to score as many headshots as possible, as fast as possible,
            <br>
            to call her next Mech. You may want to target a distant, large enemy such as Roadhog or an enemy D.Va to
            <br>
            regain your ultimate charge.
