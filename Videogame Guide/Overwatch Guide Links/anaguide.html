        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Ana is a mid to long-range Support sniper, capable of healing at any range while also maintaining a fair
            <br>
            level of damage output. Her Biotic Grenade lets her amplify healing effects from not only her own healing
            <br>
            darts but also from other Supports and environmental healing, such as Payloads and Health packs. She has a
            <br>
            sidearm which will fire a Sleep Dart, which can render the enemy who's hit with it temporary useless unless
            <br>
            someone wakes them up. Nano Boost is a supportive ultimate that is used to provide strong buffs to an ally,
            <br>
            allowing them to deal more damage while taking less damage from the enemy. She can also be an anti-healer
            <br>
            as her Biotic Grenade will prevent enemies hit by the blast from getting healed in any way, making her an
            <br>
            outstanding support. Ana lacks all source of mobility and only has her sidearm to protect herself, making
            <br>
            it easy for her to be outflanked by the flankers as well as other mobile heroes.While Ana has reasonable to
            <br>
            outstanding damage capabilities like other damage dealers, she is unable to deal any critical shots and
            <br>
            suffers from low mobility. You must focus on healing your allies rather than playing like DPS-heroes; you
            <br>
            can't act like them well on your own.
            <br>
            Ana can provide more healing than other supports due to her fast fire-rate and Biotic Grenade. Playing her
            <br>
            as a sole support will lead the enemy to prioritize you as the first target, so additional supports are
            <br>
            recommended.
            <br>
            Ana is a sniper class, which is deadly at attacking the enemy from extreme range. You can kite the enemy
            <br>
            that your teammates can't attack back like rivaled snipers or airborne targets with ease. Keep in mind that
            <br>
            you can't deal a critical shot nor heavy damage that will put them in lethal levels instantly, so try to
            <br>
            stay in cover or a friendly's barrier.
            <br>
            Biotic Grenade is a strong counter to all healing effects; such as Roadhog's Take a Breather, Zenyatta's
            <br>
            Transcendence or even an opposing Ana's Biotic Grenade. You can throw the grenade directly to the enemy and
            <br>
            contact your teammates to gang up on the effected target as they can't be healed.
            <br>
            Missing a Sleep Dart to flankers will result in your disadvantage. Try to practice your aim and adjusting
            <br>
            the dart's speed.
            <br>
            A target under the effect from Sleep Dart will be rendered useless and unable to make any actions. If your
            <br>
            combo can't finish the target, communicate your team to do so. Reinhardt's Charge is a great choice to
            <br>
            finish the target if he doesn't need to cover your team with barrier at that time.
            <br>
            Don't let the other teammates interfere in your line-of-sight while activating Nano Boost on the target.
            <br>
            You have to communicate with your teammates to whom you will give the ultimate and always have space in
            <br>
            your line-of-sight, so you can avoid giving Nano Boost to a wrong target that can't bring your ultimate to
            <br>
            any usefulness, such as Lúcio or Mercy. <br>
            The common targets for your Nano Boost should be damage dealers rather than tanks. While boosting tanks
            <br>
            will give them a better chance of surviving and greatly increase their damage, you will force them to move
            <br>
            out of their position to attack the enemy, in order to not waste the damage buff gains from Nano Boost.
            <br>
            Nano Boost works best when paired with damage dealing ultimates like Soldier: 76's Tactical Visor or
            <br>
            Reaper's Death Blossom.
            <br>
            Even though the Nano Boosted-hero will take less damage by 50%, the effected hero can still die if the
            <br>
            enemies are focusing on the boosted-hero. Try to heal the boosted-hero continuously, so that they won't die
            <br>
            in the most important engagement.
            <br>
            As Ana can both heal allies and damage enemies, along with Biotic Grenade's amplifying healing; she can
            <br>
            gain the ultimate charge quickly, so you can use the Nano Boost on your target to push or to defend
            <br>
            depending on the situations much faster than other healers. <br>
