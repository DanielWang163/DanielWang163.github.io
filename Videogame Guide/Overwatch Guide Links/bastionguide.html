        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Bastion is a hero with two main forms. Its default form is a mobile bipedal form with a sub-machine gun,
            <br>
            while the second being a completely immobile turret form. Both of these perform in unique ways, and must be
            <br>
            utilized to their fullest. The most notable part of Bastion's kit is Reconfigure, which turns it into a
            <br>
            stationary turret gun. This turret has some of the highest damage output in the game, being able to shred
            <br>
            through shields and heroes alike, but it can't deal a critical shot. In tank form, while losing some damage
            <br>
            output, it gets more crowd control ability, as the explosion of the shells fired are very large and
            <br>
            dangerous to all enemies. However, Configuration: Sentry poses two major weaknesses to Bastion. The first
            <br>
            is immobility, which causes Bastion to become an easy target to focus fire on. The second is a weak point
            <br>
            that appears on its back in turret configuration. Faster heroes can easily get behind Bastion and kill it
            <br>
            quickly with this weak point. Even though it has reasonable health and is able to repair itself in any
            <br>
            situation, the healing ability has limits and its large frame makes it an easy target. Bastion is also
            <br>
            relatively slow, making it easy to be outflanked by enemies. Bastion is played best when you mix both
            <br>
            configurations together. It should be noted that Recon Configuration's submachine gun is a highly accurate
            <br>
            weapon with reasonably high damage. Do not be afraid to change back into Recon in order to run to a better
            <br>
            spot, but try to do so behind cover.
            <br>
            You should also know how to correctly utilize Bastion's Self Repair. It is a powerful self heal, healing at
            <br>
            the rate of 25% per second, lasting until cancelled or out of charged. While you can repair yourself in any
            <br>
            situation, the healing has a charge limit. Staying in front of focused fire from enemies would be unwise as
            <br>
            the healing rate is not fast enough to compensate for the high rate of receiving damage.
            <br>
            Bastion works incredibly well with heroes who provide it with survival capability, such as Reinhardt,
            <br>
            Torbjörn and Symmetra.
            <br>
            A common tactic for Bastion on Payload modes is to pair with Reinhardt and Mercy; the barrier combined with
            <br>
            Mercy's damage amplifier will boost both Bastion's damage output and defensive capability while setting up
            <br>
            on a payload.
            <br>
            Carefully consider where to place yourself in turret mode. Change positions often (when you can safely
            <br>
            move), especially whenever you feel that the enemy knows your location or is forming a strategy against
            <br>
            you. Try to use the element of surprise to your advantage. Bastion does especially well in narrow corridors
            <br>
            and unexpected positions.
            <br>
            Bastion excels at destroying slow-moving and/or high-health targets, such as Winston, Roadhog, unshielded
            <br>
            Reinhardt, and a flying Pharah; however, in some situations you should prioritize killing high damage
            <br>
            dealing enemies, such as Reaper or another Bastion.
            <br>
            When in turret mode, Bastion's weak point is behind it, and can be seen from almost any angle except from
            <br>
            directly in front of it. Be vigilant for flankers, but try not to expose your weak point to the frontline
            <br>
            while dealing with them.
            <br>
            Bastion can go down relatively quickly when faced with focused fire from the entire enemy team, especially
            <br>
            if they have high damage output. Prioritize taking out high damage output enemies as quickly as possible,
            <br>
            or retreat.
