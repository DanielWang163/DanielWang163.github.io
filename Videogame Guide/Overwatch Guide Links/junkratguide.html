        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            While Junkrat can deal tremendous damage with his Frag Launcher, it takes a considerable amount of skill
            <br>
            and practice to accurately land grenades. In general, it's best to launch your grenades at an area, rather
            <br>
            than at a specific target, as Junkrat's biggest strength comes from his ability to make any area hazardous
            <br>
            to travel through. If you're forced to fight an opponent head on, try to lead your Frag Launcher shots so
            <br>
            that your enemy will run into them. <br>
            If you are confronted by an enemy up close, you should use either your Concussion Mine or Steel Trap to let
            <br>
            you gain some distance, even though you won't take any damage while firing grenades up close, but the <br>
            grenade is pretty slow to affect close-range enemy. <br>
            Placing your Steel Trap and Concussion Mine well are key when playing Junkrat. Your Steel Trap should be
            <br>
            placed in spots without much room to maneuver in order to force enemies to either destroy the trap or step
            <br>
            on it. This can be used to protect your flank by telling you when an enemy is coming through the area where
            <br>
            you dropped your trap. Place your Concussion Mine above a doorway or next to a wall that you know your <br>
            opponents will be traveling by. The explosion can be used to both damage and separate the enemy team, <br>
            allowing your team to pick off whoever gets blown towards you. <br>
            RIP-Tire can be tricky to use. Its loud engines can be heard clearly by your opponents, giving them a <br>
            general idea of where the tire is. Avoid driving it straight at your enemies, as they'll most likely be <br>
            able to destroy it before it gets to them, wasting your ultimate. Instead, use side routes to get the tire
            <br>
            behind your enemies, either by driving the tire through these routes, or taking the routes yourself and <br>
            then unleashing the tire once you're behind them. Keep in mind that Junkrat is completely helpless while
            <br>
            controlling the tire and easily killed, so try to activate RIP-Tire from a safe position. <br>
            Junkrat's Concussion Mine can be placed on walls, ceilings, and even basketballs. This can be used as a <br>
            tricky way to get an unexpected kill. <br>
            A combination of the Steel Trap and Concussion Mine can instantly kill 200 HP characters. Additionally, <br>
            this strategy works best when placing it over a health pack or at a well-used choke. <br>
            Junkrat excels at destroying heroes that stay in one spot, such as Torbjorn's Turret, Bastion in sentry <br>
            mode, and snipers. The surprising range means that Junkrat can take out these targets from a safe distance.
            <br>
            Professionals use RIP-Tire to take out Supports, this is a very undermined tactic, as a team without any
            <br>
            healing will be greatly disadvantaged. <br>
            One strategy for Junkrat is called the "Sexy Junkrat". This strategy, coined by Overwatch/TF2 YouTuber <br>
            Muselk, involves Junkrat's sit emote. Junkrat's sit emote can be used to hide in a bush or cart, staying
            <br>
            hidden while contesting the payload. <br>
