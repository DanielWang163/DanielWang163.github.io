        <h3>Strategy:</h3>
        <p>
            Doomfist is a close-combat fighter who excels in taking down enemy targets with his combos. With his
            <br>
            signature ability Rocket Punch, he can secure an instant kill on a non-tank hero by knocking them into a
            <br>
            wall. Rising Uppercut not only deals damage but also enables Doomfist to secure higher ground. Seismic Slam
            <br>
            is another dual-purpose ability that both provides additional mobility and deals damage based on time spent
            <br>
            in the air. After casting Meteor Strike, Doomfist becomes invulnerable while choosing his landing location
            <br>
            and then drops down, dealing damage in a large area. The Best Defense... helps him to mitigate punishment
            <br>
            from the enemy team as long as he can continue dealing damage. While Doomfist is strong up close, his
            <br>
            damage falls off at mid- to long-range. Unless he can close the distance between himself and an enemy, his
            <br>
            only option is to use Hand Cannon, which typically is better used as a finisher than as a primary weapon
            <br>
            due to its long reload time and relatively low damage. Doomfist is a high-risk, high-reward hero - while
            <br>
            his large burst damage can be used to easily pick off high-priority targets, he typically takes more damage
            <br>
            than other heroes due to his large hitbox. While Doomfist can one-shot most of the cast, actually doing so
            <br>
            is riskier than is strictly necessary. Landed Seismic Slam into Rising Uppercut is more reliable and does a
            <br>
            combined ~100 damage, requiring only two interwoven handcannon shots (three, realistically) to finish off a
            <br>
            200 HP hero, allowing for Rocket Punch to be used as an escape. Against most tanks the Rocket Punch can be
            <br>
            added to the end of the combo to knock them away or finish them off, depending on the availability of
            <br>
            walls. This combo can do substantially more damage if the Seismic slam is initiated at high altitude
            <br>
            (possibly +75 damage), requiring only one handcannon shot against a 200 HP hero to secure a kill. When
            <br>
            using the high altitude Seismic Slam it’s better to try and estimate where Doomfist will land instead of
            <br>
            where the cone will be; the cone can be reaimed, but Doomfist’s trajectory cannot. Engaging with a one-shot
            <br>
            Rocket Punch kill should be reserved for opponents who can disrupt the Seismic Slam + Rising Uppercut +
            <br>
            Handcannon Shots (SSRUHSH) combo. These are the One-Shot-Worthy:
            <br>
            Ana and McCree, as their Sleep Dart and Flashbang respectively can be thrown mid-combo and either give them
            <br>
            time to retreat, or make you vulnerable.
            <br>
            Mei, as she can freeze you after you use all of your abilities.
            <br>
            Reaper, who might kill you first due to your large hitbox.
            <br>
            Sombra, Moira, Tracer, and Widowmaker, who all might slip away mid-combo (or, in case of Sombra, hack you
            <br>
            mid-combo).
            <br>
            There are also a few enemies you should, absent favorable conditions, avoid at all costs:
            <br>
            Roadhog - Your combo is not enough to kill him outright and he can heal in between your abilities. If you
            <br>
            try to run away he gets an easy hook, and you will have no more ways out.
            <br>
            Turret Mode Bastion - Your abilities will not move him if he’s in turret mode. This removes much of
            <br>
            Doomfists's combo potential and results in a highly disfavorable fight.
            <br>
            Widowmaker/Hanzo/McCree (Open Ground): Each of your abilities moves you predictably and your Rocket Punch
            <br>
            slows you down as you charge it, opening you up to attack. Keep to cover. General Tips:
            <br>
            Don’t be afraid to cancel out of a Rocket Punch. The charge up sound is loud and clever players will begin
            <br>
            to move out of the way. You can re-engage with the SSRUSH combo after a cancel if you’re against a 200 HP
            <br>
            hero.
            <br>
            Remember that Rising Uppercut has a slight backwards push, making it useful for pushing off stage or over
            <br>
            walls in the right situations.
            <br>
            As an escape, Seismic Slam is best after Rising Uppercut.
            <br>
            Jumping while releasing a Rocket Punch will cause you to travel forward completely horizontally, as opposed
            <br>
            to along the ground. This can be useful if you want to catch a Pharah (after Rising Uppercut or jumping off
            <br>
            a ledge) or if you want to push someone off from on top of the cart (since you would otherwise hit the cart
            <br>
            itself).
            <br>
            Genji cannot deflect any of your abilities aside from Hand Cannon; charging Rocket Punch during his deflect
            <br>
            is a good idea.
            <br>
            The best time to interweave handcannon shots is after Rising Uppercut, while you and your opponent are mid
            <br>
            air. You will have built shields using your previous abilities in the SSRUSH combo and they will not be
            <br>
            able to dodge your shots. This is provided they are not on the list of the One-Shot-Worthy of course.
            <br>
            Remember that Rocket Punch can be used to knock players off the map, and that you can recover easily if you
            <br>
            hit Rising Uppercut soon enough.
            <br>
            Meteor Strike is a hard counter to McCree’s Deadeye, Reaper’s Death Blossom, Hanzo’s Dragonstrike, and
            <br>
            Moira’s Coalescence. When you hear their voice cues, use your Ultimate keybind for an easy kill.
            <br>
            Avoid using Meteor Strike on Roadhog. You are unlikely to land a kill due to his high health pool and the
            <br>
            damage reduction from Take a Breather and the landing animation provides him with a perfect opportunity for
            <br>
            a hook combo.
            <br>
            Don't hesitate to use Rocket Punch to retreat. It is better to fall back and wait for another opportunity
            <br>
            than to charge into certain death.
            <br>
            Note that while he might seem like it, Doomfist is NOT a dive character. He has one of the largest
            <br>
            hit-boxes of all non-Tanks, making him vulnerable without a team supporting him.
