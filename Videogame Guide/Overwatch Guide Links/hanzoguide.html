        <h2>Part 2: Meat Bun's Personal Guide</h2>
        <h3>Instakill Skill Combos</h3>
        <h4>Combos</h4>
        <p>There shouldn't be a combo...</p>
        <h3>Strtegy:</h3>
        <p>
            Hanzo is a medium-range sniper with strong team utility and area denial abilities. The relatively silent
            <br>
            and hard-to-see nature of his arrows makes him a stealthier sniper than Widowmaker, able to get kills and
            <br>
            then retreat before his enemies see him. His downsides include the poor aim of Storm Bow at long range,
            <br>
            often requiring him to get dangerously close to his opponents to accurately hit them.
            <br>
            While Widowmaker can usually be played from long range, Hanzo often has trouble accurately hitting
            <br>
            shots at this distance, unless his enemies are moving through a narrow space. Use Hanzo's mobility to
            <br>
            move to the side or behind your opponents to get into a position that you can both stealthily fire on
            <br>
            them and can easily escape from if they choose to go after you. Keep in mind that Hanzo is somewhat
            <br>
            deadlier than Widowmaker at close range if he is able to land headshots well, so don't be afraid of
            <br>
            standing your ground if only a single person comes after you.
            <br>
            Hanzo can have a high level of burst damage at close range. A single well-placed arrow from the Storm
            <br>
            Bow, combined with a quick melee attack, can instantly kill Tracer.
            <br>
            Storm Arrows' rather high damage per second is useful for taking down high health targets quickly.
            <br>
            Lunge can be used in a variety of ways, like in chases, disengaging, and general mobility. For example,
            <br>
            it can be used to alternate between the three high platforms in the initial stage of Rialto.
            <br>
            Dragonstrike, much like McCree's Deadeye, can be used either to score kills or to force enemies away
            <br>
            from a certain position. If using it to clear a position, try to fire it in such a way that your
            <br>
            enemies will have little choice but to either retreat or move to the side and into the line of fire of
            <br>
            your own team. Alternatively, if you have an ally like Reinhardt or Zarya on your team, coordinate your
            <br>
            Ultimate with theirs in order to deal devastating damage.
