        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            When defending on Hanamura, focus your early attention on setting up solid defenses to hold the big
            <br>
            double-gate area. Chances are the attacking team will have very few options for bypassing this passageway
            <br>
            that leads into the next part of the map, so you're better off making sure you guard this area than pushing
            <br>
            too hard into the enemy spawn area. Because of this particular chokepoint, it's highly recommended that you
            <br>
            have at least one Bastion or Torbjorn focused hard on the area. Try to find some cover before taking
            <br>
            position - if the enemy can't cut bring you down quickly then they'll become an endless stream of sitting
            <br>
            ducks just waiting to be picked off. Any defending team will benefit from a Widowmaker for similar reasons.
            <br>
            For both of the reasons listed above, making meaningful progress as the attacking team can be extremely
            <br>
            difficult on Hanamura. The key here is to maintain momentum and capitalise on any advantage you can gain
            <br>
            early on. If you manage to kill any of the defending team right by your spawn point, push forward quickly
            <br>
            as a team as you'll have less defenses waiting for you at the gate. Any shields you can bring to this part
            <br>
            of the fight will be enormously helpful. If you're attacking, don't get distracted by greedy kills if
            <br>
            someone on your team is starting to capture the point. Unless you can finish the kill quickly, get back and
            <br>
            help your team take the point faster. The same advice can apply to the defending team too, as an undefended
            <br>
            point can easily be stolen from right underneath your nose. In the second phase of the map, the defending
            <br>
            team should once again ignore the immediate section just before the capture point and set up strong
            <br>
            defenses in the objective room. There are simply too many opportunities for the enemy team to flank and
            <br>
            take you out otherwise - you don't have as far to run from the spawn room now, but it is easy to get
            <br>
            quickly overwhelmed on this map. As the defending team, you will do well to take your positions in the
            <br>
            higher balconies of the objective room. From here you have plenty of hiding spots to snipe or mount
            <br>
            turrets, but do watch out for flankers launching an ambush through the corridors. If you see someone
            <br>
            breaking off to do so, make sure you alert your teammates. Again, snipers are great for picking off
            <br>
            approaching enemy Heroes fast, and before they can start worming their way around and towards your
            <br>
            backline. Just as it was in the first section of Hanumara, it's absolutely vital that the attacking team
            <br>
            coordinates with one another. It is almost always sensible for a team member to hold back and wait for
            <br>
            their team to return before trying to single-handedly storm this defense. Strength-in-numbers is the key
            <br>
            for making progress, and surviving the initial attempt to breach the final objective.
