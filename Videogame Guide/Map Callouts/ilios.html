        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            The Ruins control point provides some outstanding cover opportunities over on the scaffolding across from
            <br>
            the tall statue. While the rest of the team fights for control in and out of the arena pit, get some cover
            <br>
            fire sorted from the sides. You have lots of opportunities to dart in and out of cover here, and a lone
            <br>
            wolf can really make a difference. Your vision of the map is horribly obscured when you're in the central
            <br>
            pit of the Ruins. Try to do as much fighting as you can outside of this zone, or to the sides if you really
            <br>
            want to stay lower down. You can see the ramps more clearly from there, and it also stops you from being
            <br>
            bunched up together for Junkrat and Pharah's benefit. When it comes to the Lighthouse objective, snipers
            <br>
            should spend some time exploring the map in a practise match. There are some wonderful balcony spots to do
            <br>
            your work from here, with great views overlooking the Lighthouse itself. We like the one that's just to the
            <br>
            right and over from the capture point, as you face it (look for the little bell tower). If you're
            <br>
            struggling to get good vision on an enemy at the Lighthouse, be aware that many of the railings can
            <br>
            actually be shot to pieces in order to give you a better field of vision. The downside of this is, of
            <br>
            course, that you blow up your own cover by doing so! Junkrat practically lives for the Lighthouse stage at
            <br>
            Ilios. Those doorwars, corridors and side alleys are just perfect for his grenades. If you hold the point,
            <br>
            boost him upstairs and onto the Lighthouse balcony if you want to cause some absolute mayhem for the other
            <br>
            team trying to make their approach. The final stage - The Well - presents an obvious trap in the form of
            <br>
            that massive drop into the abyss by the control point. Lucios love to knock people down here, so always be
            <br>
            wary of your positioning. Likewise, Roadhog's great for sticking to the perimeter of this pit, and then
            <br>
            pulling victims towards him and into the hole.
