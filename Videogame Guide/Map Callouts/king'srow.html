        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            <4>Attackers</4>
            One of the biggest problems you'll face as the Attacking team is just getting through to that first
            <br>
            checkpoint. Reinhardt can prove to be a particularly powerful option here, as that shield can provide a
            <br>
            great barrier for your team to advance behind. Your flankers in general can provide an incredible advantage
            <br>
            on this map. Characters like Tracer and Reaper excel at taking the road less travelled, slipping down the
            <br>
            assorted side alleys, and getting at some of the sticky defenses that can quickly bring an attacking team
            <br>
            grinding to a halt. It can be useful to go for the height advantage on this map, particularly in the early
            <br>
            stages where things feel particularly claustrophobic. Heroes like Pharah are great for taking to the skies
            <br>
            and then raining down the pain on the enemy Heroes attempting to hold onto the Payload / checkpoints.
            <br>
            Exercise extreme caution when you reach the final stage of King's Row as the attacking force. There are
            <br>
            balconies and ledges galore for your opponents to steal themselves behind, and it's not at all uncommon for
            <br>
            otherwise solid attacking plans to fall to pieces here. Switch Heroes if needs be to aggressively flank and
            <br>
            clear the path ahead.
            <h4>Defenders</h4>
            When defending, keep a very close eye for any snipers who might be using the many balconies and ledges to
            <br>
            pick off your team so that their friends can make a break for the Payload. More so than on just about any
            <br>
            other map in the game, King's Row demands awareness of what's going on in the air as much as on the ground
            <br>
            in front of you! If there's one Hero that's always going to be an insta-pick on King's Row it's Symmetra.
            <br>
            If the rest of the team can lock down access to the Payload, Symmetra's turrets - placed cunningly in the
            <br>
            hotel lobby entrance - will hold back even those who manage to slip through this early chokepoint. Mei is
            <br>
            another outstanding pick when it comes to frustrating the attacking team from the very start of a match on
            <br>
            King's Row. Ice Wall isn't just great for blocking off access to the Payload, it can also be used to
            <br>
            separate an opponent - the enemy's tank, for example - from their friends, leaving your team free to blast
            <br>
            them to pieces. Because the attacking team will often find themselves needing to make progress through
            <br>
            narrow interiors, Junkrat is another fine pick here. The splash damage from his lobbed bombs can be deadly
            <br>
            in confined quarters, and his traps can cause no end of bother for the opposing team too!
