        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            Any maps that involve reaching a point first and then holding it will benefit from having Lucio as their
            <br>
            Support Hero. While it's true that the objective doesn't unlock for a certain period of time, the first
            <br>
            team to get the point in one piece typically has a major advantage. Use that speed boost to get everyone
            <br>
            where they should be as quickly as possible. Junkrat is another character that becomes quite powerful on
            <br>
            Lijiang Tower. Being able to fling a whole load of explosives at the currently contested point provides a
            <br>
            powerful advantage. You might also consider taking at least one Mei with you in this game mode too - the
            <br>
            ability to throw a physical barrier here there and everywhere is a powerful one indeed. Symmetra's turrets
            <br>
            obviously bring something special to these kind of fights too. Regardless of the rest of your team
            <br>
            composition, a Pharah can be an incredibly powerful addition to your team on Lijiang Tower. There will be
            <br>
            plenty of opportunities to take to the skies and clatter your rocket fire into enemies, who will often have
            <br>
            little choice but to explore out of cover. Many buildings on this map also provide an extra entrance point
            <br>
            for Heroes who can reach high places too. You'll benefit of course from knowing the locations of the health
            <br>
            packs on all maps, but this goes double on Liiang Tower where firefights are often extremely intense. If
            <br>
            you can get your hands on a rejuvenating health boost, you'll significantly increase the odds of surviving
            <br>
            a one-on-one showdown. When you're fighting for the second capture point, be incredibly wary of the
            <br>
            bottomless pit that surrounds it. You will almost certainly take a few embarrassing tumbles into it during
            <br>
            a frantic firefight, but try to stay aware of this environmental danger at all times. The final control
            <br>
            point is a little more enclosed. If you need to find some breathing space, look for the stairwell that
            <br>
            takes you to a ledge that overlooks the actual control point. You may find yourself able to get in a kill
            <br>
            or two before you're spotted and - probably - eliminated.
