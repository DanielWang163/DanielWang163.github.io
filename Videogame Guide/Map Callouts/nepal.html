        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            Once you've captured the first point on this map, feel free to move away from the initial objective and
            <br>
            start pushing back the advancing forces. Do, however, have one eye on the point you've liberated to ensure
            <br>
            that there isn't a sneaky Tracer or Reaper flanking around to steal it from right beneath your nose. Greed
            <br>
            will get you here if you're not careful. Note that a Pharah pummelling rocketfire into this first point can
            <br>
            cause absolute chaos for the enemy team. The second temple capture point offers a height advantage to the
            <br>
            team that captures it, although keep in mind that there are four very clear directions of attack here. If
            <br>
            you're holding the point, split up and keep eyes on all possible avenues the enemy might be approaching
            <br>
            down, and call out to your team if their help is needed elsewhere. Again, don't wander off too far from
            <br>
            each other but do feel free to do a little "pre-emptive defending" if you know what we mean. If you're
            <br>
            defending the second point, have taken a lot of damage, and have an emergency healing option as part of
            <br>
            your ability set, squeeze into a corner - between you and the attackers - and restore your health. This of
            <br>
            course also provides a bonus advantage of keeping you out of the enemy team's line of sight. Keep your eyes
            <br>
            on all possible entrances to your position, and be ready to strike with the element of surprise. Characters
            <br>
            like Symmetra with her turrets, and Junkrat with his bombs, make excellent picks for the team that holds
            <br>
            the second objective. Symmetra can plant plenty of traps around the nooks and crannies of the central
            <br>
            temple - which should at least complicate an assaulting team - while Junkrat always enjoys lobbing bombs
            <br>
            around from a height advantage. Throw his explosives down those staircases to keep the enemy thinking twice
            <br>
            about pushing forward. The monastery itself can be a real beast to take and hold. You might favour Heroes
            <br>
            who are capable of throwing shields around for this part of Nepal, as there's a lot of open space that
            <br>
            needs to be held. Clear out the room adjacent to and above the actual control point if you can, as you can
            <br>
            expect a lot of firepower to come from this area when you're trying to hold the point. Don't forget that
            <br>
            you can actually knock enemy Heroes into the abyss that surrounds this third and final control point.
            <br>
            There's obviously a major risk that you'll end up joining them if the manoeuvre goes wrong, but characters
            <br>
            like Lucio in particular love to shove enemies off the ledge here, and down towards certain doom!
