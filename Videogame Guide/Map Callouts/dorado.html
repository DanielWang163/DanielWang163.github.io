        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            The way the timers work on this map are pretty simple. When the game begins, the clock is set at five
            <br>
            minutes and starts counting down. Once the Payload team reaches the first checkpoint, an extra three
            <br>
            minutes are added to the clock, while hitting the second checkpoint adds another two minutes. All told,
            <br>
            this means that a full match - not allowing for any Overtime periods - can last no longer than ten
            <br>
            minutes.Just beyond the open plaza fountain/statue, to the right as you attack, is a wall ( Labelled Fence
            <br>
            in the 4th callout picture ) that a number of characters can sneak over in the ultimate flanking manoeuvre.
            <br>
            Genji, Pharah, Reaper, Hanzon, Junkrat, Widowmaker, D.Va, Winston and Mercy can all vault over it. If
            <br>
            you're pushing the Payload, your offensive flankers should always be working through the many side passages
            <br>
            on this map, pushing forwards and clearing the road ahead of any threats - particularly as you approach the
            <br>
            first main courtyard after picking up the Payload. That first courtyard can be a killer if you let the
            <br>
            defending team take control. There are balconies and sniping spots a-plenty on this map, and both teams
            <br>
            would do well to have a well-positioned Widowmaker in their ranks, ready to pick off anyone who strays into
            <br>
            her view.
