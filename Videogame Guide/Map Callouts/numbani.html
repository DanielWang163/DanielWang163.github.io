        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            On defense, get to the left-hand side of the bridge facing the attacker's entrance - you'll be able to bag
            <br>
            a small amount of protection by hugging the entrance, while still being able to focus on the right-hand
            <br>
            exit. Drop a mine behind you to help deal with flankers. Look for balconies that have trees nearby, as this
            <br>
            extra level of protection will help you stay alive longer and pick off more targets. It's a particularly
            <br>
            useful approach if you're not the sharpest shooter in the world, but you do want to get better at picking
            <br>
            off your prey with just a little more breathing room to play with. Just ahead of the Payload is a balcony
            <br>
            that will give you a fantastic view of the entire central area of Numbani (look for the bus in the centre
            <br>
            of the road). If you're on defense and the enemy team has made good progress towards the Payload, get into
            <br>
            position and call their activity to your teammates. Further back, to the left of the Payload as you face
            <br>
            the incoming attackers, is another balcony that lets you keep tabs on the main approach, the previous
            <br>
            balcony, and the right-hand area that flankers like to charge through as well. Be very cautious about
            <br>
            setting up your defenses to the right of that Payload, particularly if you're sniping. Between the twisting
            <br>
            stairway and the flanker's exit point, there's a very good chance you're going to have an extremely bad
            <br>
            time of things if you set up camp here. Remember that - whether attacking or defending - Spider Mines are
            <br>
            your best friend as a Widowmaker player. They should always be placed in the least convenient direction you
            <br>
            would want to check for flankers from. The massive statue just after the Payload provides amazing cover for
            <br>
            a Widowmaker. Hook yourself up there as quick as you can, get around to the side that's opposite the
            <br>
            attacker's appraoch, and simply fire between the statue's legs.
