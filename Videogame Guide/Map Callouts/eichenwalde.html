        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            The way the timers work on this map are pretty simple. When the game begins, the clock is set at five
            <br>
            minutes and starts counting down. Once the Payload team reaches the first checkpoint, an extra three
            <br>
            minutes are added to the clock, while hitting the second checkpoint adds another two minutes. All told,
            <br>
            this means that a full match - not allowing for any Overtime periods - can last no longer than ten minutes.
            <br>
            Just beyond the open plaza fountain/statue, to the right as you attack, is a wall that a number of
            <br>
            characters can sneak over in the ultimate flanking manoeuvre. Genji, Pharah, Reaper, Hanzon, Junkrat,
            <br>
            Widowmaker, D.Va, Winston and Mercy can all vault over it. If you're pushing the Payload, your offensive
            <br>
            flankers should always be working through the many side passages on this map, pushing forwards and clearing
            <br>
            the road ahead of any threats - particularly as you approach the first main courtyard after picking up the
            <br>
            Payload. That first courtyard can be a killer if you let the defending team take control. There are
            <br>
            balconies and sniping spots a-plenty on this map, and both teams would do well to have a well-positioned
            <br>
            Widowmaker in their ranks, ready to pick off anyone who strays into her view. We'll have a breakdown of all
            <br>
            the best sniping spots on this map in a future update to this article.
