        <h3>Strategies</h3>
        <h4>Tips</h4>
        <p>
            Widowmaker is an obviously strong defensive pick on this map, due to the many balconies and rooftops that
            <br>
            she can make use of. When defending the first objective, she's particularly strong at turning that
            <br>
            claustrophobic chokepoint into a deadly path for the attacking team. Junkrat is also strong for spamming
            <br>
            death into the room that's adjacent to that same chokepoint, just ahead of the Payload.On the defending
            <br>
            team, a Torbjorn gets an extremely long line of sight for his turret to aim along at the incoming
            <br>
            attackers. Symmetra might think about hiding her sentry turrets in the overgrowth on the walls, just to the
            <br>
            right of the Payload as you're facing the chokepoint. They might still get picked off, but it's an extra
            <br>
            layer of confusion which can prove deadly with the rest of your team fighting on the point itself.If you're
            <br>
            on the other side of the map, you might find it useful to pack the likes of Genji or Tracer onto your team.
            <br>
            These are both excellent choices when it comes to dealing with defensive turrets, or just picking off the
            <br>
            team members who are sitting on the point. This can be a tough objective to reach in random play, and a
            <br>
            canny forward attacking squad are crucial for picking off the backline defenders.Strong tanks for pushing
            <br>
            the first objective include D.Va, Reinhardt and Winston. The ability to shield your team from projectiles
            <br>
            will almost certainly prove vital on this map, and all three of these characters excel in that regard. When
            <br>
            defending the Payload's approach through the western section, Widowmaker is obviously powerful due to the
            <br>
            many balconies and rooftops available to her. McCree is another character who excels at defending here, as
            <br>
            there's a strong likelihood of encounters at close-range. Junkrat is another Hero who can leave the pushing
            <br>
            team with no certain path to safety. If you need to help push the Payload, any characters with high
            <br>
            mobility will prove incredibly useful in this middle section. Good defending playerd will be protecting the
            <br>
            higher ground, and so if you can get up in their faces and neutralise the threat they pose, your team on
            <br>
            the ground will find it much easier to keep the Payload rolling. Think of characters like Genji, Hanzo,
            <br>
            Pharah and Winston when it comes to taking charge of the rooftops.Things get a lot less fluid for the
            <br>
            defending team in the final third of Hollywood. Here you want to go back to your basics of Torbjorn
            <br>
            turrents, well-positioned Bastions and - of course - that old defensive stalwart Widowmaker. Junkrat or
            <br>
            McCree players should be protecting the flanking points to ensure your Widowmaker gets to continue picking
            <br>
            off priority targets unharrassed. Trying to make the final push with the Payload yourself? An offensive
            <br>
            Widowmaker can help clear the path ahead nicely for the rest of your teammates, but this can be a tricky
            <br>
            final hurdel for attackers to overcome. Shields and barriers will get you over the finishing line here, so
            <br>
            again it's the likes of Winston and Reinhardt who provide the most obvious tanking advantage as you
            <br>
            approach the finishing line.
