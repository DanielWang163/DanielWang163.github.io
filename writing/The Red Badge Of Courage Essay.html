        <h2>The Red Badge Of Courage Essay</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            Henry Fleming has experienced many major changes in his mind throughout the book. In the novel The Red Badge
            of Courage by Stephen Crane, Henry Fleming is a soldier in the Northern army and he is a coward at first,
            and he fled two battles. However, after he sees his friend Jim Conklin die in front of him, his inner rage
            covers all of his cowardness, and during the next fight, Henry and his regiment are like “mule-drivers” and
            defeat the enemies easily. Then he became a real hero. Henry Fleming was a hero in three ways, Courage, Duty
            and Transformation.

            When talking about Henry Fleming’s courage, he was at first a coward. “His emotions made him feel strange in
            the presence of men who talked excitedly of a prospective battle as of a drama they were about to witness,
            with nothing but eagerness and curiosity apparent in their faces. It was often that he suspected them to be
            liars.” ( Page.20 ). This quote explains that Henry is hoping that everyone else is feeling the same way as
            him so if everyone else are all cowards, he won’t be blamed.
            “Again he thought that he wished he was dead. He believed that he envied a corpse.” ( Page.104 ). This quote
            shows that Henry is a total coward and 100% fear and probably the worst thought that Henry ever had. Most of
            the time Henry had a weird mind and was kind of silly but also makes sense . However, now, after seeing Jim
            Conklin’s death, “And, furthermore, how could they kill him who was the chosen of gods and doomed to
            greatness?” ( Page.136 ). This quote is showing that Henry is no long scared and fear of the battle, he now
            thinks himself as if he was “the chosen of gods” and his cowardness is now transformed into “dooms to
            greatness”. Impressive. With that feeling he fought with maximum courage and he even rushed for the
            Rebellion flag in battle. That is very impressive.

            When talking about Henry Fleming's duty, he was trying to escape the regiment at first. “But he instantly
            saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from the regiment. It inclosed him. And there were iron
            laws of tradition and law on four sides. He was in a moving box.” ( Page.33 ). This quote shows that Henry
            was at first trying to run away from his regiment but failed miserably. At that time of the book he was
            still scared and a coward. However, now, he is in the final battle and he suddenly found out that the ”gaze
            of his soul upon that other flag. Its possession would be high pride. It would express bloody minglings,
            near blows” ( Page.195 ). This is when Henry rushed for the Rebellion flag and captured it. His duty now was
            to fight for the North and he was rushing into the enemies recklessly.

            Henry has experienced so much transformations in throughout the novel. “He went slowly to his tent and
            stretched himself on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall soldier. In the darkness he saw visions of a
            thousand-tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee, while others were going coolly
            about their country's business. He admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster. He felt
            that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices, while other men would remain stolid and
            deaf.” ( Page.29 ). From that quote it’s easy to notice that Henry is still child like so it’s easy to see
            his changes throughout. “There was the delirium that encounters despair and death, and is heedless and blind
            to the odds. It is a temporary but sublime absence of selfishness.” ( Page.162 ). This quote is the main
            reason that Henry fights so strongly in the final battle. So showing contrast to the previous quote Henry
            has transformed from a boy into a man.

            Henry Fleming might be coward at first, but all that he’s done made him a hero at last.
