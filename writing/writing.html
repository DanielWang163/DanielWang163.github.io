        <h2>The Red Badge Of Courage Essay</h2>
        <p>
            Henry Fleming has experienced many major changes in his mind throughout the book. In the novel The Red Badge
            of Courage by Stephen Crane, Henry Fleming is a soldier in the Northern army and he is a coward at first,
            and he fled two battles. However, after he sees his friend Jim Conklin die in front of him, his inner rage
            covers all of his cowardness, and during the next fight, Henry and his regiment are like “mule-drivers” and
            defeat the enemies easily. Then he became a real hero. Henry Fleming was a hero in three ways, Courage, Duty
            and Transformation.

            When talking about Henry Fleming’s courage, he was at first a coward. “His emotions made him feel strange in
            the presence of men who talked excitedly of a prospective battle as of a drama they were about to witness,
            with nothing but eagerness and curiosity apparent in their faces. It was often that he suspected them to be
            liars.” ( Page.20 ). This quote explains that Henry is hoping that everyone else is feeling the same way as
            him so if everyone else are all cowards, he won’t be blamed.
            “Again he thought that he wished he was dead. He believed that he envied a corpse.” ( Page.104 ). This quote
            shows that Henry is a total coward and 100% fear and probably the worst thought that Henry ever had. Most of
            the time Henry had a weird mind and was kind of silly but also makes sense . However, now, after seeing Jim
            Conklin’s death, “And, furthermore, how could they kill him who was the chosen of gods and doomed to
            greatness?” ( Page.136 ). This quote is showing that Henry is no long scared and fear of the battle, he now
            thinks himself as if he was “the chosen of gods” and his cowardness is now transformed into “dooms to
            greatness”. Impressive. With that feeling he fought with maximum courage and he even rushed for the
            Rebellion flag in battle. That is very impressive.

            When talking about Henry Fleming's duty, he was trying to escape the regiment at first. “But he instantly
            saw that it would be impossible for him to escape from the regiment. It inclosed him. And there were iron
            laws of tradition and law on four sides. He was in a moving box.” ( Page.33 ). This quote shows that Henry
            was at first trying to run away from his regiment but failed miserably. At that time of the book he was
            still scared and a coward. However, now, he is in the final battle and he suddenly found out that the ”gaze
            of his soul upon that other flag. Its possession would be high pride. It would express bloody minglings,
            near blows” ( Page.195 ). This is when Henry rushed for the Rebellion flag and captured it. His duty now was
            to fight for the North and he was rushing into the enemies recklessly.

            Henry has experienced so much transformations in throughout the novel. “He went slowly to his tent and
            stretched himself on a blanket by the side of the snoring tall soldier. In the darkness he saw visions of a
            thousand-tongued fear that would babble at his back and cause him to flee, while others were going coolly
            about their country's business. He admitted that he would not be able to cope with this monster. He felt
            that every nerve in his body would be an ear to hear the voices, while other men would remain stolid and
            deaf.” ( Page.29 ). From that quote it’s easy to notice that Henry is still child like so it’s easy to see
            his changes throughout. “There was the delirium that encounters despair and death, and is heedless and blind
            to the odds. It is a temporary but sublime absence of selfishness.” ( Page.162 ). This quote is the main
            reason that Henry fights so strongly in the final battle. So showing contrast to the previous quote Henry
            has transformed from a boy into a man.

            Henry Fleming might be coward at first, but all that he’s done made him a hero at last.

        <h2>How The Age of Explorations Changed The Americas</h2>
        <h3>The Americas Before the Age of Exploration:</h3>
        <p>
            The Americas were actually settled before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492 CE; in fact, even the first
            Europeans to ever set foot in the Americas--the Vikings, who arrived in Atlantic Canada around 1000 CE but
            did not stay--arrived thousands of years after the first inhabitants of the Americas. Indigenous Peoples
            came to the Americas around 15,000 years ago, likely by boat, followed by people traveling across the Bering
            Strait, which at that time connected Asia and the Americas. There are a few myths believed about the
            Americas before the Age of Exploration. Many people think the Americas were a relatively empty place, and
            that the Indigenous Peoples who lived on these two continents had simple and similar lives. North and South
            America were not, in fact, “relatively empty places”. The estimated population of the Americas was around 90
            million to 120 million. Indigenous Peoples spread out all over the Americas and became many different groups
            and established different civilizations; some did large scale farming, and some were hunters and gatherers.
            The Indigenous Peoples’ lives were not simple and their civilizations were much more diverse than the myths
            claim.
        </p>
        <h3>The Americas During the Age of Exploration:</h3>
        <p>
            So in 1492, Christopher Columbus, representing Spain, sailed across the ocean and landed in the Bahamas.
            Spain began to set up what was soon called New Spain in the Americas, and later other European countries
            began to set up settlements and colonies. The establishment of European settlements meant that Indigenous
            Peoples lost land over time. They will also die from the disease that got brought by the Europeans. The
            Europeans can survive in America, in the beginning, is all because of Indigenous people's help, if they
            don't have Indigenous peoples help they won't survive that easily because they don't know this place, it a
            whole new place for the Europeans so they don't know where they can live that is saved and where are the
            foods and water, everything that they know in the beginning was all from the Indigenous people. So the
            Europeans and the Indigenous peoples both benefit from each other like the Indigenous people learn a lot of
            new technology from the Europeans and the Europeans learn a lot of knowledge of land from the Indigenous
            peoples. Overall, I think that it more harmful for the Indigenous peoples, because of that a lot of
            Indigenous peoples died from the disease that got brought by the Europeans and they lost of land in America,
            even they learn a lot of new technology from the Europeans but the Europeans also learn a lot of land skill
            from them so I think that more harmful for indigenous peoples.
        </p>
        <h3>The Lasting Results on the Americas of the Age of Exploration: </h3>
        <p>
            The results of the Age of Exploration to the Americas was that the Americas was literally taken over. From
            the map below, be can see that the Indigenous Peoples’ lands were mostly under European control. The
            Europeans gain more political control of Americas at expense of the Indigenous peoples. On the other hand,
            The age of exploration brought the Americas closer to the world and made the world more globalized, which is
            beneficial. After that, the Americans gained more knowledge of the rest of the world and benefitted other
            continents with their own knowledge.
