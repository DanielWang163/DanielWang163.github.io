        <h2>How The Age of Explorations Changed The Americas</h2>
        <h3>The Americas Before the Age of Exploration:</h3>
        <p class="indent">
            The Americas were actually settled before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492 CE; in fact, even the first
            Europeans to ever set foot in the Americas--the Vikings, who arrived in Atlantic Canada around 1000 CE but
            did not stay--arrived thousands of years after the first inhabitants of the Americas. Indigenous Peoples
            came to the Americas around 15,000 years ago, likely by boat, followed by people traveling across the Bering
            Strait, which at that time connected Asia and the Americas. There are a few myths believed about the
            Americas before the Age of Exploration. Many people think the Americas were a relatively empty place, and
            that the Indigenous Peoples who lived on these two continents had simple and similar lives. North and South
            America were not, in fact, “relatively empty places”. The estimated population of the Americas was around 90
            million to 120 million. Indigenous Peoples spread out all over the Americas and became many different groups
            and established different civilizations; some did large scale farming, and some were hunters and gatherers.
            The Indigenous Peoples’ lives were not simple and their civilizations were much more diverse than the myths
            claim.

        <h3>The Americas During the Age of Exploration:</h3>
        <p class="indent">
            So in 1492, Christopher Columbus, representing Spain, sailed across the ocean and landed in the Bahamas.
            Spain began to set up what was soon called New Spain in the Americas, and later other European countries
            began to set up settlements and colonies. The establishment of European settlements meant that Indigenous
            Peoples lost land over time. They will also die from the disease that got brought by the Europeans. The
            Europeans can survive in America, in the beginning, is all because of Indigenous people's help, if they
            don't have Indigenous peoples help they won't survive that easily because they don't know this place, it a
            whole new place for the Europeans so they don't know where they can live that is saved and where are the
            foods and water, everything that they know in the beginning was all from the Indigenous people. So the
            Europeans and the Indigenous peoples both benefit from each other like the Indigenous people learn a lot of
            new technology from the Europeans and the Europeans learn a lot of knowledge of land from the Indigenous
            peoples. Overall, I think that it more harmful for the Indigenous peoples, because of that a lot of
            Indigenous peoples died from the disease that got brought by the Europeans and they lost of land in America,
            even they learn a lot of new technology from the Europeans but the Europeans also learn a lot of land skill
            from them so I think that more harmful for indigenous peoples.

        <h3>The Lasting Results on the Americas of the Age of Exploration: </h3>
        <p class="indent">
            The results of the Age of Exploration to the Americas was that the Americas was literally taken over. From
            the map below, be can see that the Indigenous Peoples’ lands were mostly under European control. The
            Europeans gain more political control of Americas at expense of the Indigenous peoples. On the other hand,
            The age of exploration brought the Americas closer to the world and made the world more globalized, which is
            beneficial. After that, the Americans gained more knowledge of the rest of the world and benefitted other
            continents with their own knowledge.
