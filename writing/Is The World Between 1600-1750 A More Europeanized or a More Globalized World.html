        <h2>Is The World Between 1600-1750 A More Europeanized or a More Globalized World?</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            The World between 1600-1750 was filled with chaotic events that contained a lot of colonization. There are
            many facts to say that the world was more Globalized than Europeanized. For Example, after tea became
            fashionable in Europe in the 1700s, Chinese tea was sold for a huge amount into. The Qing Dynasty became so
            rich and powerful that once new commands are made out, foreign people had to kneel to receive them. The
            Manchus also made several nations into vassal status. Including Tibet, Annam, Burma, Mongolia, and
            Turkestan. Thus making the Chinese Empire the world’s largest at the time. Also, for more than six hundred
            years, from 1299 until 1922, the Ottoman Empire was one of the biggest and longest lasting Empires in
            history. The Ottoman Empire controlled many cross-continental trade routes at the time.

            There were also reasons that the world was Europeanized at the moment. We all know that almost all of North
            and South America is colonized by European powers. That is very high-value evidence that the world was being
            Europeanized at the time. The Great Britain and the Dutch Empire grew a lot, colonizing almost everywhere
            they reach. The British Empire and the French Empire also attacked one of the representative Empires on the
            Globalized side, the Mughal Empire, in the 1700s. Their attack was very successful that it took the entire
            Empire down and captured all if the Mughal Empire’s land. Also in the eighteenth century, the British were
            establishing control in India, the Dutch had a strong presence in South Africa, and the French had taken
            over Indochina. So they were all going very great at the time and that clearly shows Europeanization over
            Globalization.

            So our opinion on the topic was 50 50 on both sides. Although Europe was doing so great and was colonizing
            all over the place, there are still many other strong places that didn’t let them take the Europeanized
            name. The Ottoman Empire and the Qing Dynasty was two of the greatest Empires at the time in our opinions.
            The Ottoman and the Qing Dynasty Grew rapidly and was doing great in the range of year that was given in the
            topic and Excellently dogged the time they declined. These two Empires also controlled most of the trading
            routes. The European Empires were also doing great but it was just not enough to call the time a
            Europeanized period between 1600-1750.
