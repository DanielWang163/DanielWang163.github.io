        <h2>How The Age Of Explorations Changed Africa</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            People think that slavery only happened when the Europeans came to Africa but Africans were enslaving even
            before the Europeans came to Africa, there is a wide variety of tribes in Africa and they were often at war,
            every time a tribe wins a war, they would take the people of the other tribe and enslave them. Another fact
            is that Africa was weak and helpless. The Egyptian empire was and still is one of the strongest empires to
            ever exist. When the country reached its height in wealth, prestige, and military strength the empire
            stretched from Syria in the north to Sudan.

            As the age of exploration ushered in, things turned worse for Africa. As the Renaissance began, life and
            technology began to improve so it was a good time to explore Africa. As the Europeans arrive in America,
            indigenous people were dying from the diseases the Europeans brought in which makes them not very good
            slaves. To satisfy the European’s demand for slaves, they started enslaving the Africans in return for
            goods. There were two ways of getting slaves for the Europeans. The main way is for the Africans to go to
            war with other Africans. They would then enslave the side that lost and sell them to the Europeans for
            goods. When the Europeans feel like they are not getting enough slaves they would sometimes forcefully
            enslave and sell them. Which in result creates population loss, chaos and violence and that really hurt
            Africa’s development then and in the future. In the meantime, the Europeans began settling in Africa. The
            Europeans were thinking about controlling Africa, but that doesn’t fall into the age of exploration but
            instead, Age of Imperialism but that is a topic for another day.
