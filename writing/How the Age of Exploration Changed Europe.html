        <h2>How the Age of Exploration changed Europe</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            As you know Europeans decided to begin exploring the world around 1492 CE which was during the Renaissance
            (1300~1600). The Renaissance was a bridge between the Middle Ages and the Modern Age. It was a short golden
            age and revolutionized time in Europe. The Age of Exploration lasted during the Renaissance, and Europeans
            had many different purposes to begin the exploration. The most important purposes are called “the three Gs”.
            The first G is gold, after the Silk Road, Europe lacked materials. Europeans needed more goods like spices
            and valuables, they also wanted to become wealthier. The second G is God, religions, especially
            Christianity. Since they already sufficiently spread Christianity in Asia, they needed to find a new place
            to spread it. The exploration was necessary for religious people. The last G is glory which means Europeans
            wanted new territory, a bigger empire, and greater power. These were the purposes of the exploration.

            Why did the exploration happen during the Renaissance? Europeans had a curiosity about the world and
            adventure. Many improvements made exploration easier than ever. They improved in many different things such
            as astronomy, geography, and art during the Renaissance. In the middle ages, it was not possible to create
            something and make something a theory without a pope’s control. Renaissance was the age without any cruel
            management of the pope, and the political system in Europe became better than ever. For example, scientists
            invented something such as celestial navigation and found some surprising discoveries like heliocentric
            theory. They could build humongous and sturdy ships that could travel far away along the Atlantic ocean.
            They made the compass and astrolabe to help them travel in the ocean as well. Since the improvements were
            made, the exploration was possible and Europeans could travel farther than before. After the things were
            made, Portuguese began exploring under the leadership of Henry the Navigator. He sent the ships and worked
            with his people for exploration. After all, in 1492, Christopher Columbus found the route to travel from
            Europe to the Americas and this impacted many voyagers to travel.
