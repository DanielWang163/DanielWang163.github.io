        <h3>The Americas Before the Age of Exploration:</h3>

            Here I am, at the Christmas Island Golf Club participating in the Summer Golf Games. The game is first to
            666, I’m so ready to win.
            <br>
            <br>
            A FEW MONTHS LATER.
            <br>
            <br>
            Wow, the game is tied 655-655, it’s now my turn. I swung the stick and just then, a Seagull crushes on it
            and it fell right beside my foot. I miserably looked at the score board. 665-665. It’s my opponent’s turn.
            Somewhere deep down in my heart I call the god of the seagulls to hit my opponent’s ball as well. Then, my
            opponent swung, he swung and suddenly a million seagulls came rushing for the ball, after a minute of the
            ball war, the ball crashed strait downed landed on a… crab? This must be a tie, but why didn’t it end.
            Everyone looked at the crab as it crawled towards the hole and fell in it. Everyone cheered and I looked at
            the score board and 665-666, my opponent won. I rushed for the judge and he shoved a rules book into my hand
            like it’s always gonna happen. Then I carefully read the rules and left miserably.
