        <h2>Festive Recording Takeaways</h2>

            Once you get a new instrument like a bass drum that you can’t bring with you, hit it a few times so that you
            get the way to play with the song. You can improve it by hitting it a few time to get used to it. I applies
            to me maybe when I get a new flute before performing or maybe didn’t play my flute for a while before
            performing, I need to get used to the flute before getting on stage
        </p>

            Have like a crescendo in the last trumpet two bar note in Coldwater Crossing to fit the percussion since
            they are doing a crescendo to fit the band well. You can improve by listening to the other parts of the band
            to decide what are your best not tone choices. It applies to me because since I sit in the front corner of
            the band, I could hear the band as an audience better than the others, I could adjust the band more easily
            and better uit the band.

            In The Pilgrimage measure 21 part the saxophone 3rd note is a dotted quarter note, they didn’t hold that
            long enough. You can improve it by watching the rhythm and count the rhythms in your head. It also can apply
            to me in my piano exam, the sight reading part I usually struggle with requires a lot of counting in my
            head.

            Not enough support on the Trumpet part at measure 37 in The Pilgrimage on the high notes. You can improve it
            by setting the air support and air speed. In the Coldwater Crossing measure 41 I also struggle on the high
            notes which requires a lot of air support.
        </p>

            The sax and the trumpet part measure 22 part could be tongued a little bit lighter or else it might be
            punched out a little too strong if your are doing a staccato like articulation. You can improve it by
            practicing the lighter articulations probably. In the Coldwater Crossing measure 13 the articulations is
            also quite difficult when going in regular speed, maybe that applies to me as well.
